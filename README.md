# Memorize words

This project is converting a figma design to a simple app.

No CSS framework is used, and it is coded as mobile-first, responsive HTML5/CSS3 code.

The app is a Javascript app which utilizes jQuery library.

User tries to answer meaning of words in Serbian & English languages. 

Words are shown randomly in Serbian or in English. 

If user answers correctly, the word is removed from the list (which is asked to user).

If user answers correctly, thumps up count increases and if user answers wrongly thump down count increases.

Total answers, total correct and total wrong answers stored until the end of game.

If user answers wrongly, the word stays in the list and asked again in another random round.
